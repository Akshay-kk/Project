WETTABILITY ALTERATION IN CARBONATE  RESERVOIR THROUGH CHEMICAL EOR

Recovery from fractured, oil-wet/mixed-wet, carbonate reservoirs by 
waterflooding is poor. Dilute surfactant methods are being developed to 
improve oil recovery from fractured carbonates. This paper investigates the 
interactions of dilute alkaline anionic surfactant solutions with crude oil on 
carbonate mineral surfaces. Wettability, phase behavior, interfacial tension 
and adsorption experiments have been conducted. Anionic surfactants have 
been identified which can change the wettability of the calcite surface to 
intermediate/water-wet condition as well or better than the cationic surfactant 
DTAB with a West Texas crude oil. All the carbonate surfaces (Lithographic 
Limestone, Marble, Dolomite and Calcite) show similar behavior with 
respect to wettability alteration with an anionic surfactant. Anionic 
surfactants, which lower the interfacial tension with the crude oil to very 
low values, have also been identified. The adsorption of the sulphonate 
surfactants can be suppressed significantly by the addition of the alkali.
